Corresponding bit and its roubleshooting guide should be followed.",
            "RECOMMENDED ACTION": "• If you have the Line HECS/CT code, the line current measurement is not what is expected at this level of dc current. Either of the CT DC HECS and there burden resistors may be damaged or programmed incorrectly. For example, the DC HECS may actually be 2500:1, the drawings and parameters indicate 4000:1. Another cause would be an unplugged DC HECS.\n• If you have the CT Phs Seqn code, the CTs are likely swapped. For example the CT/wiring for 2U has been switched with 2W.\n• If you have the CT Phs/Alpha code, the rectifier is firing with the wrong firing angle relative to the angle measured from the line current. This can occur when the CTs on an 18-pulse rectifier are switched between master and slaves.\n• If you have the Cap/CT Error code, this only occurs for PWM rectifiers when nergized and not running. The line current measured by the CTs does not match the expected line current based on the capacitor parameters and measured voltage. Possible causes are incorrect capacitor, CT or burden resistor parameters, and in some cases, blown TSN fuses.\n• If you have the Motor HECS code, this only occurs when running on the motor in open loop mode. The drive compares the motor current to the dc current, and flags this fault if there is a significant difference. If there were no Line HECS/CT codes, then the likely cause of this fault in an incorrectly programmed motor HECS value or burden resistor. Other causes could be a defective or unplugged motor HECS.\n• Make sure hardware parameters are correct and do not exceed the range."

Before an individual leg is fired, the drive takes 5 samples of the voltage across that device. This is because the notching on the line could cause individual readings to be low. If they are all low, the device is assumed to be short-circuited and a fault occurs. There is also a parameter called Rectifier Device Diagnostic Delay (P266), which allows you to change the number of consecutive firings to eliminate nuisance faults. It will still check 5 times before each firing, but will now require the condition to exist for the number of consecutive firings set in the Diagnostic Delay parameter for a fault to occur.",
